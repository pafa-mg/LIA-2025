Our first and most successful product is [OneGate](https://www.mobilityguard.com/products/onegate/) which is an access management solution used by most municipalities and many government agencies in Sweden. We also work with The Swedish Defence Ministry (Försvarsmakten) and other important actors in Sweden.

Every Swede is actually using our product without knowing it, for example when you login to do your tax declaration at [Skatteverket](https://skatteverket.se/), or if you register your pet cat at [Jordbruksverket](https://jordbruksverket.se/). Check the url and you will see `mg-local`, mg = MobilityGuard.

Our latest product is [WizePass](https://wizepass.com/) which is an electronic identification solution, similar to BankId but much more powerful. 

WizePass solves multiple problems that BankId can not, and the original idea came about when our Swedish municipality customers needed to switch to a 100% digital national exam for their middleschool students. BankId and other competitors are all tightly tied to social security numbers (personnummer) and could not be used for minors, WizePass solves this by being much more flexible and not tied to a specific attribute. 

WizePass also allows you to have multiple WizePasses on the same device, which is useful when you have a shared work device used by many and still want the same security standard as BankId. For example when working in elderly care and using a shared iPad to access patient's charts or similar.

You can check out our WizePass app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wizepass&hl=en_US&pli=1) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/wizepass/id1660064425).

Right now MobilityGuard is expanding nationally and internationally with interested parties all over the world. We are in the process of signing a contract with a major IT firm in Sri Lanka, and we are in talks with multiple Ambassadors in Stockholm about using WizePass as their national electronic ID solution. We recently started a project with BK Häcken football club to use WizePass for their sponsor events and in the future Gothia Cup. It's all very exciting and it means we need all the help we can get, that's hopefully where you comes in!

## What are we looking for?
- **Java** System Developers, preferably fullstack

## What internship periods?
May 2025 and forward.

## What will our interns do?
Both OneGate and WizePass use Java as their backend. OneGate, being over 20 years old, is as you might expect a so-called "monolith"-application using Java 11 LTS. WizePass uses the Quarkus framwork, maven and modern microservices architecture with Java 21 LTS.

**Interns** will mainly work on **WizePass** but we are also looking at projects modernizing **OneGate**. 

**Backend** interns on the multiple APIs, adding and refactoring endpoints and solutions as needed. 

**Frontend** interns will work on the Enrolment interface and Admin interface connected with WizePass. These interfaces uses Vite with React, and either Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS libraries. The enrolment interface is what our customers use to issue a user a new WizePass. The Admin interface is what we use to set up the microservices and all connected entities, and will later be used by our customers to admin their enrolment interfaces and other customer owned services.

**OneGate** also needs some love.**Backend** interns will help with simple refactors in specific parts of the monolith as well as create APIs in preparation for refactoring the control center GUI connected to OneGate, now generated with PHP. This control center GUI is something our **frontend** interns will be able to help us recreate with React or similar frameworks. Making the GUI go from fancy 1990s-PHP-look to a more modern easier-to-use look. 

The OneGate team is also looking at breaking out certain parts of the monolith into their own microservices, as well as adding new features ans their own microservices using modern frameworks.

One possible project for **OneGate** is so-called **PAM service** which will let outside consultants access the system temporarily through admins granting them access. Another is a **Risk Management Interface** module which will let admins access their risks and OneGate will use this to configure itself accordingly.

## What does work at MobilityGuard look like?
Our office is in the old Partille train station buildings, all of which our CEO owns. This beautiful landmark (k-märkt) building has high ceilings, old wooden floors, and easy access to both train (being the train station) and bus connections from Gothenburg and the commuter train from Alingsås.

We use the Agile methodology with two week sprints, daily stand-ups in the mornings, and an Agile project board located in GitHub, integrated with GitHub issues and pull requests. It works well, and the team is very close and works tightly together. We prefer our interns spending as much time as possible in the office to get the help and support they need, but if you live far away or similar it's possible to work from home at least some of the week.

The Partille office is our headquarters, but we have offices in Spain, Colombia and some other international locations. It is possible to work from Spain in the future, if this is of interest. There are 7 full time developers, 2 support staff, 4 account managers, 2 groundskeepers, the CEO Johan Sundström and the financial manager here in the office, and we have a lot of fun going on conferances, trips and AWs togther. Every Tuesday we play floor ball (innebandy) here in a local school that the company pays for. We have a good time!
